README: Binary Search program written by Aaron Pitman

Program uses binary search to locate a target value input by the user. The user may search repeatedly, until the integer 0 is input. Note: the program will end if the enter key is hit with no input.

the program starts with an unsorted array of integers. The array is then sorted using the algorithm quickSort. 

binarySearch and Quicksort are both implemented recursively.
